The CommComm has authority over outward-facing community outreach efforts, including:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Community Evangelism\nEducation Initiatives\nCultural Direction of Node.js Foundation\nCommunity Organization Outreach\nTranslation and Internationalization\nProject Moderation/Mediation\nPublic Outreach and Publications</code></pre></div>\n<p>There are four types of involvement with the Community Committee:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">A Contributor is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.\nA Collaborator is a contributor who has been given write access to the repository\nAn Observer is any individual who has requested or been requested to attend a CommComm meeting. It is also the first step to becoming a Member.\nA Member is a collaborator with voting rights who has met the requirements of participation and voted in by the CommComm voting process.</code></pre></div>\n<p>For the current list of Community Committee members, see the project’s README.md.\nContributors and Collaborators</p>\n<p>It is the mission of CommComm to further build out the Node.js Community. If you’re reading this, you’re already a part of that community – and as a part of the Node.js Community, we’d love to have your help!</p>\n<p>The nodejs/community-committee GitHub repository is a great place to start. Check out the issues labeled “Good first issue” to see where we’re looking for help. If you have your own ideas on how we can engage and build the community, feel free to open your own issues, create pull requests with improvements to our existing work, or help us by sharing your thoughts and ideas in the ongoing discussions we’re having in GitHub.</p>\n<p>You can further participate in our ongoing efforts around community building - like localization, evangelism, the Node.js Collection, and others - by digging into their respective repositories and getting involved!</p>\n<p>Before diving in, please be sure to read the Collaborator Guide.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in participating in the Community Committee as a committee member, you should read the section below on Observers and Membership, and create an issue asking to be an Observer in our next Community Committee meeting. You can find a great example of such an issue here.\nObservers and Membership</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in becoming more deeply involved with the Community Committee and its projects, we encourage you to become an active observer, and work toward achieving member status. To become a member you must:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Attend the bi-weekly meetings, investigate issues tagged as good first issue, file issues and pull requests, and provide insight via GitHub as a contributor or collaborator.\nRequest to become an Observer by filing an issue. Once added as an Observer to meetings, we will track attendance and participation for 3 months, in accordance with our governance guidelines. You can find a great example of such an issue here.\nWhen you meet the 3 month minimum attendance, and participation expectations, the CommComm will vote to add you as a member.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Membership is for 6 months. The group will ask on a regular basis if the expiring members would like to stay on. A member just needs to reply to renew. There is no fixed size of the CommComm. However, the expected target is between 9 and 12. You can read more about membership, and other administrative details, in our Governance Guide.</p>\n<p>Regular CommComm meetings are held bi-monthly in a Zoom video conference, and broadcast live to the public on YouTube. Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to the next meeting’s agenda by logging a GitHub Issue.</p>\n<p>Meeting announcements and agendas are posted before the meeting begins in the organization’s GitHub issues. You can also find the regularly scheduled meetings on the Node.js Calendar. To follow Node.js meeting livestreams on YouTube, subscribe to the Node.js Foundation YouTube channel. Be sure to click the bell to be notified of new videos!\nConsensus Seeking Process</p>\n<p>The CommComm follows a Consensus Seeking decision making model.</p>\n<p>When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator will ask “Does anyone object?” as a final call for dissent from the consensus. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins vote is called. It is expected that the majority of decisions made by the CommComm are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":""}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"37de802e-00c6-5bfc-b18a-b35fd8500e2c","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/datamodel/"}}},{"node":{"id":"47f8b669-e3bd-59f0-a087-45dc5bb8a78f","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/documents/"}}},{"node":{"id":"65a869a4-1e72-534e-99a7-fc79329a60ca","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/"}}},{"node":{"id":"ed893806-6e35-5d77-bcfe-eb647c2c40cd","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/menu-screens/"}}},{"node":{"id":"fb56de1b-76ca-58b9-9b01-f152e3adb33f","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/pubsub/"}}},{"node":{"id":"a5bb2984-6af1-5e60-a8ef-2b2158027038","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/screens/"}}},{"node":{"id":"fe539be1-9ca9-5518-a6b6-233fc97f1802","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/community/"}}},{"node":{"id":"9114754e-27cf-525c-813c-6f7be817a7a3","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/governance/"}}},{"node":{"id":"36e78aa4-a934-5030-8e9f-024eb9ba6cea","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/"}}},{"node":{"id":"8fd2e6c0-9beb-5606-8b5e-2f0e833e8df5","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/releases/"}}},{"node":{"id":"f892e5cf-6956-5e43-b717-d7839ba8fd09","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/roadmap/"}}},{"node":{"id":"43532318-b061-5ac2-99c3-541161700c57","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/workingGroups/"}}},{"node":{"id":"81d8bff9-6d07-5b78-a499-711ea394b5aa","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/governance/current/legal/"}}},{"node":{"id":"6fa4f828-c442-5899-8e9e-43046d161a3a","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/overview/"}}},{"node":{"id":"9c3d7c79-e54a-5f66-8eb0-5e48c12f5c49","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/developer/v1/widgets/"}}},{"node":{"id":"929e996a-402e-581c-9833-f3919d6e2042","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome"},"fields":{"slug":"/administrator/v1/"}}},{"node":{"id":"55681734-ff92-5cff-bdeb-b461ceaf22eb","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/administrator/v1/billing/"}}},{"node":{"id":"909053fe-f2a0-5a7c-89bc-e995f4071a7d","frontmatter":{"title":""},"fields":{"slug":"/administrator/v1/deployment/"}}}]},"siteSearchIndex":{"index":{"version":"0.9.5","fields":["title"],"ref":"id","documentStore":{"docs":{"37de802e-00c6-5bfc-b18a-b35fd8500e2c":{"id":"37de802e-00c6-5bfc-b18a-b35fd8500e2c","title":""},"47f8b669-e3bd-59f0-a087-45dc5bb8a78f":{"id":"47f8b669-e3bd-59f0-a087-45dc5bb8a78f","title":""},"65a869a4-1e72-534e-99a7-fc79329a60ca":{"id":"65a869a4-1e72-534e-99a7-fc79329a60ca","title":""},"ed893806-6e35-5d77-bcfe-eb647c2c40cd":{"id":"ed893806-6e35-5d77-bcfe-eb647c2c40cd","title":""},"6fa4f828-c442-5899-8e9e-43046d161a3a":{"id":"6fa4f828-c442-5899-8e9e-43046d161a3a","title":""},"fb56de1b-76ca-58b9-9b01-f152e3adb33f":{"id":"fb56de1b-76ca-58b9-9b01-f152e3adb33f","title":""},"a5bb2984-6af1-5e60-a8ef-2b2158027038":{"id":"a5bb2984-6af1-5e60-a8ef-2b2158027038","title":""},"9c3d7c79-e54a-5f66-8eb0-5e48c12f5c49":{"id":"9c3d7c79-e54a-5f66-8eb0-5e48c12f5c49","title":""},"b6e92a8b-fc37-5c12-9606-0af19c6f3e10":{"id":"b6e92a8b-fc37-5c12-9606-0af19c6f3e10","title":"User"},"154601ca-b6d0-5822-845d-2d514c9d65ab":{"id":"154601ca-b6d0-5822-845d-2d514c9d65ab","title":""},"55681734-ff92-5cff-bdeb-b461ceaf22eb":{"id":"55681734-ff92-5cff-bdeb-b461ceaf22eb","title":""},"84cff1d0-6030-5925-bacf-71c88de2491e":{"id":"84cff1d0-6030-5925-bacf-71c88de2491e","title":"User"},"fe539be1-9ca9-5518-a6b6-233fc97f1802":{"id":"fe539be1-9ca9-5518-a6b6-233fc97f1802","title":""},"9114754e-27cf-525c-813c-6f7be817a7a3":{"id":"9114754e-27cf-525c-813c-6f7be817a7a3","title":""},"36e78aa4-a934-5030-8e9f-024eb9ba6cea":{"id":"36e78aa4-a934-5030-8e9f-024eb9ba6cea","title":""},"8fd2e6c0-9beb-5606-8b5e-2f0e833e8df5":{"id":"8fd2e6c0-9beb-5606-8b5e-2f0e833e8df5","title":""},"f892e5cf-6956-5e43-b717-d7839ba8fd09":{"id":"f892e5cf-6956-5e43-b717-d7839ba8fd09","title":""},"43532318-b061-5ac2-99c3-541161700c57":{"id":"43532318-b061-5ac2-99c3-541161700c57","title":""},"81d8bff9-6d07-5b78-a499-711ea394b5aa":{"id":"81d8bff9-6d07-5b78-a499-711ea394b5aa","title":""}},"docInfo":{"37de802e-00c6-5bfc-b18a-b35fd8500e2c":{"title":0},"47f8b669-e3bd-59f0-a087-45dc5bb8a78f":{"title":0},"65a869a4-1e72-534e-99a7-fc79329a60ca":{"title":0},"ed893806-6e35-5d77-bcfe-eb647c2c40cd":{"title":0},"6fa4f828-c442-5899-8e9e-43046d161a3a":{"title":0},"fb56de1b-76ca-58b9-9b01-f152e3adb33f":{"title":0},"a5bb2984-6af1-5e60-a8ef-2b2158027038":{"title":0},"9c3d7c79-e54a-5f66-8eb0-5e48c12f5c49":{"title":0},"b6e92a8b-fc37-5c12-9606-0af19c6f3e10":{"title":1},"154601ca-b6d0-5822-845d-2d514c9d65ab":{"title":0},"55681734-ff92-5cff-bdeb-b461ceaf22eb":{"title":0},"84cff1d0-6030-5925-bacf-71c88de2491e":{"title":1},"fe539be1-9ca9-5518-a6b6-233fc97f1802":{"title":0},"9114
