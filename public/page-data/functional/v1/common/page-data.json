A user role will allow them to submit timesheets and manage their details. Whereas an administrator or owner can do everything. The only difference is an administrator cannot delete a company. </p>\n<p>Once you’ve invited the user, they will need to <a href=\"../../user/1.0/company/#join_company_email\">verify their email</a> address and setup a password before they can access your company on Kudoo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/company/user_invited_success.png\" alt=\"User invited success\"></p>\n<p>As you can see in the above screenshot, we have successfully invited the user, however their account is still listed as <code class=\"language-text\">PENDING</code>.
