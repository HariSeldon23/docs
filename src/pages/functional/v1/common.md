![Manage companies](assets/company/manageCompanies.png)

Click on **Create new company**

![Create a company](assets/company/createCompany.png)

As you can see in the above screenshot, the logo is added. This will ensure that your companies logo will be included on all the stationary (Purchase Orders, Invoices etc.) that are sent through Kudoo.

![Create company 2](assets/company/createCompany2.png)

If you scroll down you will see some important fields
* Country
* GST 
* Business Type

Depending on what Country you have chosen you will see slightly different fields. For example, within Australia, GST is used. However if you have chosen Country as USA, then you will see the field name "Sales Tax".

If you chose "Yes, I'm registered". Then Kudoo will automatically calculate your Tax owed and received.

Click Save.

![Create company 3](assets/company/createCompany3.png)

Congratulations you have created your first Company!

## <a name="invite_users"></a> Invite new user to a company
So you've just setup a company and you're excited to get your fellow staff members on board. In the top right hand corner, you'll see a cog icon. Anytime you click that cog, the settings will appear.

![Company settings](/assets/company/settings.png)

If you then click under `Company settings` on the `User` link, you'll be navigated to the `Users` section.

From this screen you can then click the `Invite new user` button.

![Company users](/assets/company/company_users.png)

This will open the Invite User screen, which you can use to invite users.

![Invite users unfilled](/assets/company/invite_user_unfilled.png)

![Invite user filled](/assets/company/invite_user_filled.png)

**Please note** you need to be careful about which role you want to assign to your users. A user role will allow them to submit timesheets and manage their details. Whereas an administrator or owner can do everything. The only difference is an administrator cannot delete a company. 

Once you've invited the user, they will need to [verify their email](../../user/1.0/company/#join_company_email) address and setup a password before they can access your company on Kudoo.

![User invited success](/assets/company/user_invited_success.png)

As you can see in the above screenshot, we have successfully invited the user, however their account is still listed as `PENDING`. Only one the user confirms their email address and sets a password, will their account be changed to `ACTIVE`.

## <a name="delete_company"></a> Delete a company
Sometimes you may need to delete a company. **Please note** that in Kudoo, even if you delete a company, we will only permanently delete it after 7 days. This helps protect you in case you've made a mistake.

If you're adamant that you'd like to delete your company and you are the company owner in Kudoo, then you can navigate to settings screen.

![Company settings](/assets/company/settings.png)

Under `Company settings` click `General`. Once the page has loaded, scroll to the bottom.

![General company settings](/assets/company/general_delete.png)

Click on the `Delete this company` link

You will then be prompted with a popup to confirm you'd like to delete the company.

![Confirm delete company](/assets/company/confirm_delete.png)

You will then get confirmation that the company has been archived.

![Company delete successful](/assets/company/company_delete_success.png)

If you haven't re-activated the company after 7 days, it will be permanently deleted.
