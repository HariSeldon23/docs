# Finance

# Assets
Creating an account is your first step into the world of Kudoo. We have guides for the following:

#### [Asset Groups](#asset_groups)
#### [Depreciation](#depreciation)
#### [Create an Asset](#create_asset)

## <a name="asset_groups"></a> Asset Groups
Asset groups are a way to logically group your assets against their Depreciation method.

We currently support:
* [Straight line depreciation](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/15/straight-line-depreciation)
* [Reducing balance depreciation](https://debitoor.com/dictionary/reducing-balance-depreciation)

**Please note** the useful life is in months.

# Ledger

#### [Main accounts](#main_accounts)
#### [Auto postings](#ledger_postings)
#### [Journals](#journals)

## <a name="main_accounts"></a> Main accounts
Main accounts are the accounts that make up your companies [Chart of Accounts](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/14/the-chart-of-accounts). 

When you first create a company in Kudoo, we automatically create a default set of Main accounts. The reason we do this, is so that when you transact we can record all the financial transactions automatically.

**However** we also give you the option to load your own Main accounts. This is helpful when you are migrating from an existing system and would like to bring across all historical transactions. 

## <a name="ledger_postings"></a> Auto postings
Ledger postings are the rules that determine how the sub ledgers data flows through to the Ledger. 

We have the following auto postings automatically setup when a new company is created in Kudoo:
* Debtors Control
* Tax payable
* Tax receivable
* Revenue
* Bank

# Reporting

Kudoo provides a full suite of financial reports. As much as possible we try to be compliant with both [IFRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards) and [GAAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAAP).

However in some instances there may be small aesthetic changes. For example under [IAS 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_1) the naming for `Income statement` becomes `Statement of comprehensive income`. We have stuck to the shorter naming convention for brevity sake.

#### [Income statement](#income_statement)
#### [Balance sheet](#balance_sheet)
