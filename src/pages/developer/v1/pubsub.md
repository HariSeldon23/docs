# Plans
PubSub is a feature we will introduce in version 2. This will allow Developers to invoke custom logic on a data entity.

For example let's say you'd like to invoke some custom logic everytime a Customer is created, you will then be able to via PubSub. You'll be able to subscribe to a Topic on our messaging bus and then write whatever logic you like. 

You can then run that custom logic on your own servers or Kudoo's.
